The idea is actually come from a very simple paradigm: take care of the app availability. For instance, if it must be a high available server, then think about online migration for the database and gradual rollout for the clients. But in reality, it can't be that simple, because we sometimes forget that very simple paradigm when in panic: just take a look for your app availability. It is basically a negotiable percentage, but it always depends on how mission-critical your app is. This talk will tell you a quick tips and trick on how we can migrate and always releasing, always increasing version of the app, without sacrificing availability and stability.`,
